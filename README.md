# VMS — Vehicle Management System

A production-grade **multi-tenant SaaS backend** for fleet management, rental operations, and workshop management. Built with NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, and Socket.IO.

---

## Features

- **Multi-tenant SaaS** — complete tenant isolation, every query scoped by tenantId
- **Role-based access control** — SUPER_ADMIN / ADMIN / EMPLOYEE / DRIVER
- **Admin approval workflow** — new admins register and wait for platform approval
- **Branch management** — admins can create branches and manage them individually or in aggregate
- **Feature flags** — opt-out model per tenant (disable specific modules like workshop, tracking, etc.)
- **Real-time GPS tracking** — Redis cache + WebSocket broadcast
- **Background jobs** — BullMQ scheduled jobs for alerts and offline detection
- **Immutable audit trail** — all state-changing requests automatically logged
- **Comprehensive alerts** — document expiry, contract expiry, maintenance due, vehicle offline
- **Workshop management** — job cards with parts/labor breakdown and atomic cost tracking
- **Reporting** — mileage, fuel, profit/loss, vehicle usage reports

## Role Hierarchy

```
SUPER_ADMIN
  - Platform owner
  - Manages tenants, approves/rejects admin applications
  - Bypasses all role, tenant, and feature guards
  - Can override anything in emergencies

ADMIN
  - Company owner (one per tenant)
  - Approved by SUPER_ADMIN before they can operate
  - Manages users, branches, vehicles, drivers, all operations
  - Can enable/disable feature modules for their tenant

EMPLOYEE
  - Staff member (created by ADMIN)
  - Operational access: bookings, trips, maintenance, fuel, etc.
  - Cannot manage users or branches (read-only on branches)

DRIVER
  - Linked to a user account via Driver record
  - Can start/end own trips (assignment-verified)
  - Can push GPS location
  - Cannot access management endpoints
```

---

## Admin Registration & Approval Flow

1. Admin calls `POST /auth/register` -> Creates Tenant (inactive) + User (PENDING)
2. SUPER_ADMIN reviews via `GET /admin-applications`
3. SUPER_ADMIN calls `PATCH /admin-applications/:userId/approve` -> Both activated
4. SUPER_ADMIN can also: reject, suspend, or reactivate at any time

---

## Feature Flags (Opt-Out, SUPER_ADMIN Controlled)

All features are **enabled by default**. Only the **SUPER_ADMIN** can enable or disable specific modules for a tenant.

**Example:** SUPER_ADMIN gives tenant `clx1def456` access to only `vehicles` and `bookings` by disabling everything else:

```http
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/workshop/disable
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/maintenance/disable
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/tracking/disable
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/fuel/disable
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/accounting/disable
PATCH /feature-access/clx1def456/reports/disable
```

ADMIN can **view** their own tenant's active feature flags via `GET /feature-access` but cannot change them.

| Feature Key | Covers |
|---|---|
| `vehicles` | Vehicles, Drivers |
| `workshop` | Workshop |
| `maintenance` | Maintenance, Documents |
| `tracking` | GPS Tracking |
| `bookings` | Bookings |
| `fuel` | Fuel |
| `accounting` | Accounting, Expenses, Income |
| `reports` | Reports |
